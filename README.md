A python revision app for displaying questions and submitting answers.

The user must select a subject from a list of buttons. Once selected, a question will pop up and the user must type the answer.
If the answer is correct, the app will say "correct". Otherwise, it'll say "incorrect".
Answers are not case sensitive.
